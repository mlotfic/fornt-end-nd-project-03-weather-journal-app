## Overview
This project requires you to create an asynchronous web app that uses Web API and user data to dynamically update the UI. 

## Instructions
This will require modifying the `server.js` file and the `website/app.js` file. You can see `index.html` for element references, and once you are finished with the project steps, you can use `style.css` to style your application to customized perfection.

## Extras
If you are interested in testing your code as you go, you can use `tests.js` as a template for writing and running some basic tests for your code.

## Glossary

### Server-side

- It refers to operations performed by the server in a network.
- In web development, we used the Server-side scripting technique to employ scripts on a web server that produces a response for each user's request.

### Client-side

- It refers to operations performed at the client or user's end.

### Package

- It is a file or directory defined by a `package.json`.
- The npm registry contains many packages which are node modules or include node modules.

### Module

- Any file or directory in the `node_modules` directory that can be loaded by the `Node.js` require() function is known as a module.

### Arrow function

- An arrow function is a compact alternative to a traditional function expression.

### HTTP Request

- It is an action to be performed on a resource identified by a given request-url.
- Some HTTP request methods are GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, etc.

### GET

- GET is an HTTP request method used to request data from a specified resource.

### POST

- POST is an HTTP request method that requests the web-server to accept the data enclosed in the body of the request message.
